# minishell

## What is it?

Project that I made in School 21 (aka Ecole 42). The gial of this project was to implement our own Unix shell. Project was made in 
partnership with https://github.com/bklvsky. My part of the work was to learn about termcap, implement builtins and handle signals. After research we 
decided to use readline library. Throug this project we learned a lot about bash, processes, pipes and redirects. There was some troubles we faced while
working on heredoc and signals, but we were able to sucsessfully overcome it. I am really grateful to my partner for work she does. We worked as a real 
team and she never refused me in help. She told me everything she knew about pipes and I really appreciate that. 

## How to launch

Use ``make`` to compile and ``./minishell`` to run.
